# Daily Reads

This Daily Reads is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because I love reading horoscopes and random quotes. I feel that through horoscope or random qoute is a beautiful tool for individuals to use to give guidance when it comes time to make a decision and give comfort during stressful times.
